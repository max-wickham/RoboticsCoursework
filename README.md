# RoboticsCoursework

--timeline-- 

submission deadline: 14th March
live demo: week of 21st Mar

week6 (21st Feb): (lab)
  > to do:
  - finish simulator (squares in all four axis)
  - trajectory computation (straight line with variable speed) 
  - current position computation
  - ask input format of task 3 (drawing) and make compatible program
  - create functions for each movement type for task 2 (cubes)
  - write down task 4 ideas
  - design gripper for task 3 and print
  > in the lab:
  - more test on IK and precision
  - measurements on cubes and test on task 2 (and 3)
  - ask Spiers about task 4 ideas
  > goals:
  - finishing task1 suimulation
  - finish task2 cubes
  - try and test task 3 drawing
 
week7 (28th Feb): (extra session)
  > to do:
  - decide task 4 and implement
  - print more for task 3/4
  > in the lab:
  - (more testing task 3 and gripper)
  - tests on task 4
  - performance evaluation (speed, smootheness, novelty etc)

week8 (7th Mar): (lab)
  - Video demo (quality)
  - Report
  - finalise task 4
  
week9 (14th Mar): *Deadline Report and Video* (extra session?)
  - submit video and report
  - get ready for live demo
  
week10 (21st Mar): *Demo*
